# Abstract

INTRODUCTION: Epidemiological research has suggested that inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) reduces the overall risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). TNF-α antagonists have been suggested as a potential treatment for AD.

METHODS: We used a two-sample Mendelian randomization design to examine the causal relationship between blood TNF expression, serum TNF-α levels, and RA on AD risk.

RESULTS: Our results do not support a causal relationship between TNF expression, serum TNF-α levels or RA on AD risk.

DISCUSSION: These results suggest that TNF-α antagonists are unlikely to reduce the risk of AD.
